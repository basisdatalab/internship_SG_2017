		<p class = "p1">
		A Daisy flower is composed of white petals and a yellow center, although the flower can sometimes have a pink or rose color.
	</p>
	
	
	
		<p class="p2">
		Daisies are not made of just one flower. A Daisy is made up of two types of flowers - disk florets and petal-like white ray florets. 
	</p>

		<p class="p3">
		The disk florets are at the center and the ray florets are at the periphery but they are arranged to give the impression of being a single flower. This arrangement on Daisies is a type of inflorescence known as a capitulum.
	</p>
	

		<p class="p4">
		The stems of Daisies are smooth and leafless and support a single flower. Daisy plants have 3 - 4 inch flower stalks. The Daisy leaf texture varies and may be smooth or hairy, narrow at the base and slightly lobed. The Daisy flower stalks are generally longer than the leaves.
